  // The dynamic memory manager. Uses a basic Cheney-style semi-space copying
  // collector. To keep things extremely simple, this GC has a couple of
  // restrictions.
  //
  //   * It will not force a garbage collection during an allocation. Instead,
  //     it relies checkCollect() being called at some convenient time before
  //     memory is needed. checkCollect() will do a collection if the amount of
  //     free space is below some threshold. As long as you never need to
  //     allocate more than that threshold between calls to checkCollect(),
  //     everything works fine.
  //
  //   * It does not trace temporaries that are on the stack. The only roots it
  //     knows about are the ones in the provided RootSource. This means that
  //     you should not call checkCollect() while there are references to GC
  //     objects on the C stack.
  //
  //   * You must be very careful about `this`. This is a copying collector, so
  //     every live object will move when a collection occurs. If you call
  //     checkCollect() while you are inside an instance method of some GC class
  //     then that object itself will be moved, invalidating the this pointer.
  //     Trying to access any instance after that will do Bad Things. To avoid
  //     this, checkCollect() should only be called when no GC object methods
  //     are on the stack.
  //
  // What can I say, it's my first GC.
